# Claude Code Search MCP - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We created an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows Claude to search through its own conversation history. This enables Claude to answer questions about past work, find specific code implementations, and track activity over time.

## Key Features

1. **Unified Search API** - Just 3 functions that cover all use cases:
   - `searchProjects` - Find projects by name, path, or activity time
   - `searchMessages` - Flexible message search with multiple filters
   - `getActivitySummary` - Aggregate view of work over time

2. **Session Navigation** - Each message includes:
   - `sessionIndex` - Position within the session
   - `sessionMessageCount` - Total messages in session
   - Allows fetching message ranges for context

3. **Comprehensive Search Options**:
   - Text search across all messages
   - Time-based filtering (ISO 8601 timestamps)
   - Project filtering
   - Message type filtering (user/assistant)
   - Pagination support

4. **Tool Usage Tracking** - Assistant messages include `toolsUsed` array showing which tools were called (Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)

## Architecture

```
claude-code-search-mcp/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts         # MCP server setup and tool handlers
│   ├── types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces
│   ├── sessionLoader.ts # Loads and parses Claude JSONL files
│   ├── search.ts        # Search implementation
│   └── booleanParser.ts # Boolean query parser and evaluator
```

## How It Works

1. **On Startup**: Loads all Claude Code sessions from `~/.claude/projects/`
2. **Message Parsing**: Extracts content from both user and assistant messages
3. **Project Detection**: Decodes folder names and tracks project metadata
4. **Search Execution**: Filters and ranks messages based on query parameters
5. **Result Formatting**: Returns JSON with proper pagination and metadata

## Example Queries It Can Answer

- "What did we work on yesterday?"
- "How did we install perplexity mcp globally?"  
- "How many projects did we work on yesterday?"
- "How did we resolve the pip installation error the other day?"

## Technical Decisions

1. **No Time Parser Needed** - Claude provides machine-readable timestamps
2. **Boolean Search** - Full boolean query support with AND/OR/NOT operators and parentheses
3. **Simple Text Search** - Falls back to word matching for non-boolean queries
4. **Session-Based Context** - Messages tracked by position for easy range queries
5. **Minimal Dependencies** - Just MCP SDK and glob for file finding
6. **TypeScript** - For type safety and better development experience

## Performance

- Loads ~59,000 messages in ~5 seconds
- Searches execute in milliseconds
- Memory efficient with streaming JSONL parsing
- Handles 100+ session files without issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching** - Cache parsed sessions to speed up startup
2. **Vector Search** - Add semantic search for better query understanding  
3. **Smart Summaries** - LLM-powered summaries of search results
4. **Export Functions** - Export conversation history in various formats
5. **Analytics** - More detailed activity tracking and insights

## Installation & Testing

```bash
npm install
npm run build
./install.sh  # Adds to Claude Code automatically using 'claude mcp add'
```

### Verified Working:
- ✅ Successfully added to Claude Code via `claude mcp add -s user`
- ✅ Shows up in `claude mcp list`
- ✅ Claude Code recognizes the MCP tool when asked to use it
- ✅ All functions tested and working with 58,971 messages across 21 projects
- ✅ Boolean search with AND, OR, NOT, parentheses, and phrase search
- ✅ Complex queries like `(error OR bug) AND (pip OR python)`

### Integration with Claude Code:
```bash
# Example usage
claude -p "Use claude-code-search to find what I worked on yesterday"
```

The MCP server is fully integrated and functional with Claude Code!
